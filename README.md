## Motivation

One of the peculiarities of recruitment is opacity. Recruitment should be a business of transparency and openness because **this is not about Apples or PCs but people**.

We are committed to change that model with a candidate-centric approach and, as a first step towards our goal, **we have *open-source*d the contracts we use with both talent/candidates and hiring companies** so they can be read, studied, compared, discussed and used by the Community.

It's just a small contribution but hopefully it is the first step in disrupting the status quo of recruiting. You can take a look at **our manifesto** and learn more about us on [our website](https://www.getmanfred.com/).

## Getting Started

**It is important to distinguish between language and jurisdiction**. Law changes depending on where the contract object is located (affecting legal jurisdiction) but language may also introduce material changes through malicious or accidental redactions made in local language - this can be hard to confirm or understand as at the end of the day it's a private agreement.

As such, files in our contracts repository follow this nomenclature:

* candidates: 'candidates_' + COUNTRY + [ISO 369-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1), for language (e.g. candidates_SPAIN_ES.md)
* companies: 'companies' + COUNTRY + [ISO 369-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1), for language (e.g. companies_SPAIN_ES.md)

Contracts are provided "as is" and there are no guarantees or warranties attached to them. If you want to use them, please do so at your own risk. We always recommend you seek independent, professional legal advice.

## The Candidate Contract

This is the contract between an agent and the candidate, where candidate gives a mandate (a set of orders and requirements) to agent.

In this contract, you can:

* Define both candidate and agent info
* Set the candidate mandate
* Rights and obligations of both parts (especially for Privacy)

> Currently, no contract must be signed by candidates. Instead of it they just need to accept [our Privacy Policy](https://www.getmanfred.com/privacy-policy.html).


## The Company Contract

This is a contract between an agent and a company, where the company can define their need(s) (e.g. a job position with specific requirements). If agent opens a hiring process accordingly and a candidate is hired, the agent will receive a fee (% of candidate's gross annual salary (first year salary), payable by company.

In this contract, you can:

* Define both company and agent info
* Set the company needs
* Set the agent fee

We also have clauses to manage the entire hiring process. We draft all clauses based on our very own 'candidate-centric' model.

## The Fee

Some people asked us why we didn't include a explicit fee in the contract template. The answer is very simple: because they are templates.

These contract templates can be used by everyone, and everybody can decide which fee they want to charge. **Nowadays, we charge 15%** but the recruiting standard fee is around 15-20% or even 30%. It depends on the market and profiles.
